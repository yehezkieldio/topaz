Topaz is a personal platform built to track, organize, and revisit my reading journey through fanfiction, webnovels, and serialized internet fiction. It is tailored specifically for fanfic and long-form web content. Topaz helps me catalog what I’ve read, what I’m currently reading, and what I want to return to, without relying on fragile browser bookmarks, cluttered spreadsheets, or unreliable third-party services.
